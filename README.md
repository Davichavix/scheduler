# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book interviews between students and interviewer. The React front end makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a seperate database.

A link to the scheduler API is here - Both Scheduler and Scheduler-api are requried to run simultaneously for full project functionality.
[scheduler-api](https://github.com/Davichavix/scheduler-api)

# Interview Scopes
- Appointments are between 12PM and 5PM, Monday to Friday
- Each appointment is one student and one interviewer
- Interviewer is chosen from predefined list
